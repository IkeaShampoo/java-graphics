# java-graphics
I finished this simple graphics rendering engine in Java in April 2021.
I apologize for the indentation; everything was written in a plain text editor on
a Raspberry Pi, and I think I mixed tabs and spaces.
When the program in Main is run, a test is launched that renders a scene that includes
multiple triangles of varying colors, as well as a pyramid-shaped light source.
The triangles are rendered with shadow mapping and both diffuse and specular lighting,
although the only triangle with enough gloss to be visibly specular is the red one.
The camera perceiving the scene can be moved around by entering keys w/a/s/d/x/c and
rotated by entering keys q/e/r/f into the terminal.
